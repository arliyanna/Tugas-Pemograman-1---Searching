Introduction to Artificial Intelligence lecture
1. Task Definition
   Analyze and design a Genetic Algorithm (GA) algorithm and implement it into a computer program to find the values of 𝑥 and 𝑦
so that the minimum value of the function is obtained:

with domains (value limits) for 𝑥 and 𝑦:

Things you have to analyze and design:
- Chromosome design and decoding method
- Population size
- Parent selection method
- Genetic operation methods (crossing over and mutation)
- Probability of genetic operations (𝑃𝑐 and 𝑃𝑚)
- Generation change method (survivor selection)
- Evolution termination criteria (loop)
The process that you have to create to be implemented into program lines is:
- Decode chromosomes
- Fitness calculation
- Parent selection
- Crossover
- Mutation
- Generation Change

2. Output Program
   With the problem defined above, the output of your program:
- the best chromosome, and
- the values of 𝒙 and 𝒚 from decoding the best chromosome.
